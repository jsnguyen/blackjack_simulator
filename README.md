# Blackjack Simulator

Super simple blackjack simulator written in Rust! There's a function for playing the game in the command line, and a function for running the simulation. Comment out whichever you don't want to do.

Just take a peek in `src/main.rs`, the code should mostly be self explanatory!

By default, the program runs the simulation and spits out the results on the commandline and file.

Just do:

`cargo run`

Just a warning: this code is neither clean nor efficient, just a quick project for fun!
